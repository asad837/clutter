Just wrapped up a mini project that involved organizing files in a directory using Node.js! I wrote a script that categorizes files based on their extensions and moves them into corresponding folders. It was a great exercise in working with file systems, asynchronous functions, and error handlingâ€”all essentials in backend development.
